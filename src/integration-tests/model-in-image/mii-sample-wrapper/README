These are stand-alone 'wrapper' scripts for automating the
model-in-image sample.

NOTES! 

  These scripts are NOT part of the sample. They're used by the
  test framework to automate testing of the sample.

  When modifying these scripts, make sure (a) the test programs
  that depend on them continue to work, (b) that you try
  not to add dependencies on any test framework, and (c)
  that the number of lines of code in any one script that actually
  do anything significant averages less than 20.

  The reason for (b) is mostly an attempt at encapsulation.

  The reason for (c) is historical.
