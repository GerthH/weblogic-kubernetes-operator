# Usage: 'stage_model_configmap.sh'
#
#   If 'WORKDIR/model-configmap' doesn't already exist, this script
#   stages wdt model files from './sample-model-configmap' 
#   to 'WORKDIR/model-configmap'.
#
#   The staging is for a Kubernetes configmap that is optionally
#   referenced by the  domain resource 'configuration.model.configMap' field.
# 
#   The './create-model-configmap.sh' script uses
#   'WORKDIR/model-configmap' by default.
#
# Optionally set these environment variables:
#
#   WORKDIR
#     Working directory for the sample with at least 10GB of space.
#     Defaults to '/tmp/$USER/model-in-image-sample-work-dir'.
#
# CUSTOMIZATION NOTE:
#
#   If you want to specify your own model files for a config map, then
#   you don't need to run this script. See MODEL_CONFIGMAP_DIR in 
#   'create-model-configmap.sh'
