# By default, this script deploys a model configmap named
# '${DOMAIN_UID}-wdt-config-map' from files in the 'WORKDIR/model-configmap'
# directory that were staged by 'stage-model-configmap.sh'.
#
# If the 'MODEL_CONFIGMAP_DIR' env var is customized, then this script
# instead deploys the configmap from the given directory.
#
# Note that this config map is only loaded at runtime if:
#  - its referenced secret(s) are deployed 
#    (See 'INCLUDE_MODEL_CONFIGMAP' in 'create-secrets.sh'.)
#  - a domain resource references these secrets in
#    configuration.model.secrets
#    (See 'INCLUDE_MODEL_CONFIGMAP' in 'stage-domain-resource.sh'.)
#  - a domain resource references the configmap
#    in configuration.model.configMap.
#    (See 'INCLUDE_MODEL_CONFIGMAP' in 'stage-domain-resource.sh')
#
# Optional environment variables:
#
#   WORKDIR                  - Working directory for the sample with at least
#                              10GB of space. Defaults to 
#                              '/tmp/$USER/model-in-image-sample-work-dir'.
#   DOMAIN_UID                - defaults to 'sample-domain1'
#   DOMAIN_NAMESPACE          - defaults to 'sample-domain1-ns'
#   MODEL_CONFIGMAP_DIR       - defaults to '${WORKDIR}/model-configmap' 
#                               (a directory populated by stage-model-configmap.sh)
