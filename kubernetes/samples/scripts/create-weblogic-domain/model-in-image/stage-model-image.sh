# Usage: 'stage_model_image.sh'
# 
# This script stages a wdt archive and then stages a wdt model
# and the zipped archive to directory MODEL_DIR for future inclusion
# in a model-in-image image. In detail:
#
#   - It defaults MODEL_DIR to
#     'WORKDIR/models/image--$(basename $MODEL_IMAGE_NAME):$MODEL_IMAGE_TAG'.
#
#   - It copies WDT model files from 'SCRIPTDIR/sample-models/WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE/*'
#     into 'MODEL_DIR' if MODEL_DIR doesn't already exist.
#
#   - It copies the 'SCRIPTDIR/sample-archive' directory tree to the
#     'WORKDIR/archives/image--$(basename $MODEL_IMAGE_NAME):$MODEL_IMAGE_TAG'
#     directory if the target directory doesn't already exist.
#     The 'SCRIPTDIR/sample-archive' direcctory contains an exploded ear
#     jsp application.
#
#   - It zips the archive target directory contents and puts
#     the zip in 'MODEL_DIR/archive1.zip' even if 'MODEL_DIR/archive1.zip'
#     already exists.
#
# Optionally set these environment variables:
#
#   WORKDIR
#     Working directory for the sample with at least 10GB of space.
#     Defaults to '/tmp/$USER/model-in-image-sample-work-dir'.
#
#   WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE 
#     'WLS' (default), 'JRF', or 'RestrictedJRF'.
#
#   MODEL_DIR
#     Location to stage the model files. Default is:
#     WORKDIR/models/image--$(basename $MODEL_IMAGE_NAME):$MODEL_IMAGE_TAG
#
# CUSTOMIZATION NOTES:
#
#   If you want to specify your own model files for an image in this
#   sample, then you have two options: 
#    (1) DO NOT run this script. Instead, export the MODEL_DIR environment
#        variable to point to the location of your custom model files
#        prior to building your image as per the instructions in 
#        './build-model-image.sh'.
#    (2) Run this script, modify the resulting WORKDIR/archive directory
#        and/or MODEL_DIR, then run this script again (to zip the
#        archive to the MODEL_DIR), and finally run './build-model-image.sh'.
